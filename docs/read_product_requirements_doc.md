# Me A Story Tell - Product Requirements & User Flow Specification

## Executive Summary

Me A Story Tell is a live, interactive storytelling platform designed to connect families through shared video experiences. This document outlines the core user flows, feature specifications, and implementation roadmap for a freemium platform that prioritizes ease of connection between family members (particularly grandparents and grandchildren) while building sustainable engagement through gamified reading progression.

**Strategic Focus:** Launch timing targets Thanksgiving-Christmas 2025 family connection season, with simplified guest experience featuring 3 exceptional public domain story adaptations. Technical architecture prioritizes connection reliability over feature complexity, with Supabase Realtime managing both WebRTC signaling and story state synchronization.

## Core Value Proposition

**Primary Goal:** Enable meaningful connections between family members through collaborative storytelling over video calls, with particular focus on grandparent-grandchild relationships.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Zero-friction guest mode requiring no account creation
- People-first video design with story overlays (not storybook with video frames)
- Cross-generational usability optimized for seniors and children
- Reading progression system that grows with child development

### **Technical Foundation & Architecture Decisions**

**Core Infrastructure:**
- **Supabase Realtime:** Unified platform managing WebRTC signaling, story state synchronization, and participant presence
- **WebRTC P2P Architecture:** Direct peer-to-peer connections minimize server costs and maximize quality
- **Graceful Degradation:** Audio-only fallback, automatic quality adjustment, seamless reconnection
- **Public Domain Content:** Risk-free story adaptations from Aesop's Fables and Brothers Grimm collections

**Connection Reliability Strategy:**
```javascript
// Single Supabase channel handles both WebRTC and story state
const channel = supabase
  .channel(`story-room-${roomId}`)
  .on('broadcast', { event: 'webrtc-offer' }, handleRTCOffer)
  .on('broadcast', { event: 'story-choice' }, updateStoryState)
  .subscribe()
```

**Architecture Principles:**
- Connection reliability prioritized over feature complexity
- Single platform (Supabase) reduces integration complexity
- Guest sessions managed client-side to avoid authentication requirements
- Story state persistence ensures session recovery after connection issues
