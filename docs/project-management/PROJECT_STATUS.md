# Project Status â€” Me A Story Production Development

## Current Phase: Phase 1A (Foundation & Migration)

### Overall Progress
- **Start Date**: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1A (Weeks 1-2 of 12-week plan)
- **Next Milestone**: Complete MVP to React/TypeScript migration

## Weekly Status

### Week 1 (Current)
**Status**: âœ… Completed
**Focus**: Infrastructure setup and architecture foundation

#### Completed âœ…
- [x] Production development plan documented
- [x] Project management structure created
- [x] MVP code moved to `apps/mvp/` folder for reference
- [x] New React/TypeScript project initialized in `apps/read/`
- [x] Core dependencies installed (Zustand, Supabase, Tailwind, etc.)
- [x] Tailwind CSS configured with brand colors
- [x] Basic project structure created (components/, stores/, types/, etc.)
- [x] TypeScript type definitions created
- [x] Supabase client configuration set up
- [x] Zustand stores for state management (room, UI)
- [x] Basic component architecture established
- [x] Environment variables template created

#### In Progress ðŸ”„
- [ ] Supabase project configuration and database schema
- [ ] WebRTC signaling migration from custom server to Supabase Realtime
- [ ] Test the new React application

#### Planned ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Configure Supabase project and database schema
- [ ] Begin WebRTC signaling migration
- [ ] Create video calling components
- [ ] Implement story synchronization

### Week 2 (Upcoming)
**Focus**: Core component migration

#### Planned Tasks
- [ ] Migrate video calling functionality to React components
- [ ] Implement story synchronization with Supabase
- [ ] Create responsive layout system
- [ ] Set up basic authentication flow

## Key Decisions Made

### Tech Stack âœ…
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- **State**: Zustand
- **Backend**: Supabase (Data + Auth + Realtime)
- **Hosting**: Netlify
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

### Architecture Decisions âœ…
- **Component Structure**: Feature-based organization
- **State Management**: Zustand stores for room, story, and user state
- **WebRTC**: Migrate from custom WebSocket to Supabase Realtime
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with proper schema

## Current Blockers

### None identified at this time

## Risk Status

### High Priority
- **WebRTC Migration Complexity**: Medium risk - extensive testing required
- **Timeline Pressure**: Low risk - phased approach provides flexibility

### Medium Priority  
- **Supabase Learning Curve**: Medium risk - team familiarization needed
- **Component Architecture**: Low risk - well-established patterns

### Low Priority
- **Performance Optimization**: Low risk - addressed in Phase 3
- **AI Integration**: Low risk - planned for Phase 3

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate** (Today):
   - Test the new React application (`npm run dev`)
   - Set up Supabase project and configure environment variables
   - Create database schema

2. **This Week**:
   - Begin WebRTC signaling migration
   - Create video calling components
   - Test basic room functionality

3. **Next Week**:
   - Complete component architecture
   - Test basic video functionality
   - Begin story synchronization

## Team Capacity

### Current Workload
- **Development**: 100% focused on Phase 1A infrastructure
- **Design**: 20% planning component architecture
- **Testing**: 0% (will increase in Phase 2)

### Resource Allocation
- **Week 1**: 100% infrastructure and setup âœ… COMPLETED
- **Week 2**: 70% component migration, 30% testing
- **Week 3+**: 50% development, 30% testing, 20% optimization

## Communication

### Weekly Check-ins
- **Monday**: Sprint planning and progress review
- **Friday**: Retrospective and next week planning

### Documentation Updates
- **Daily**: Code changes and decisions
- **Weekly**: Progress updates and blocker resolution
- **Bi-weekly**: Architecture and design reviews
