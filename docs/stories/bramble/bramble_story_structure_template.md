# Bramble Bear Series - Story Structure Template

## Core Story Architecture

### Page Layout Structure
- **Pages 1:** Title page
- **Pages 2-3:** Opening scene (character voice, setting, initial situation)
- **Pages 4-5:** Encounter first supporting character + setup
- **Pages 6-7:** **Decision Point 1** + first choice (A or B)
- **Pages 8-11:** Side journey based on DP1 choice
- **Pages 12-13:** Encounter second supporting character + **Decision Point 2**
- **Pages 14-17:** Side journey based on DP1+DP2 choices
- **Pages 18-19:** Encounter third supporting character + **Decision Point 3**
- **Pages 20-23:** Final pathway to ending
- **Pages 24:** Resolution/ending page

*Total: ~24 pages (12 spreads) - appropriate length for target age group*

## Decision Point Logic System

### Pathway Mapping
**DP1:** Choice A or B
**DP2:** Two versions based on DP1 (DP2-A version, DP2-B version), each with 2 choices
- Creates 4 possible pathways: 1A2A, 1A2B, 1B2A, 1B2B

**DP3:** Three versions that group pathways by thematic "net effect"
- **Version 1:** 1A2A (consistent approach in one direction)
- **Version 2:** 1B2B (consistent approach in other direction) 
- **Version 3:** 1A2B + 1B2A (mixed approaches = "balanced/neutral" version)

### Ending Connections
Each DP3 version connects to one core ending theme:
- **Consistent Direction 1** → Ending Theme 1
- **Consistent Direction 2** → Ending Theme 2  
- **Balanced/Mixed** → Ending Theme 3

## Character Integration Pattern

### Supporting Cast as Signposts
- **Character 1:** Energetic/immediate problem (teaches about pace and approach)
- **Character 2:** Thoughtful/complex situation (teaches about understanding and listening)
- **Character 3:** Practical/culminating challenge (tests everything learned)

### Ancillary Characters for Variety
- Use different minor characters in side journeys based on pathway choices
- Ensures rereadability and pathway differentiation
- Examples: Mrs. Hedgehog, field mice family, young squirrels, etc.

## Thematic Framework

### Core Learning Themes
1. **Helping Others vs. Self-Care Balance**
2. **Understanding What Help Is Actually Needed** 
3. **Working Together vs. Going Alone**

### Choice Value Types
- **Speed vs. Thoughtfulness**
- **Independence vs. Collaboration**  
- **Immediate action vs. Planning ahead**
- **Following instructions vs. Creative solutions**

## Writing Consistency Elements

### Maintain Throughout All Pathways
- Character voice and catchphrases
- Julia Donaldson-style rhythm and repetition
- Gentle consequences that teach without punishing
- Circular storytelling (endings that tie back to character growth)
- Age-appropriate vocabulary with occasional "stretch" words

### Illustration Guidance Principles
- Each spread should support the choice points visually
- Weather/environmental changes track story tension
- Character expressions and body language reinforce emotional beats
- Visual pathways suggest different choice directions

## Reusability Notes

### Adaptable Elements for Future Stories
- Same decision point structure works for different scenarios
- Same character order can be varied (Willow first, then Pip, then Hazel, etc.)
- Same pathway logic applies to any three-choice-theme setup
- Template length and pacing proven for target age group

### Scenario Variations
- Seasonal challenges (storms, snow, drought, etc.)
- Community events (festivals, celebrations, moving day, etc.)
- Personal growth moments (new friends, fears, accomplishments, etc.)
- Problem-solving adventures (mysteries, lost items, broken things, etc.)

This template provides the structural backbone for multiple stories while ensuring consistency in character development and reader experience.
