The wind was beginning to whistle through the trees, and the leaves rustled with urgent whispers: *Storm coming, storm coming, better get ready!* Bramble felt his heart do a little flip-flop—not from worry, oh no, but from excitement. When the woodland needed help, Bramble's helpful paws always seemed to know just what to do. \"I can help with that!\" he said to the storm clouds, as if they might listen and nod. But as he looked around the woodland, he heard different sounds coming from different directions. Through the trees, he could hear Pip bouncing frantically around his burrow, calling \"Race you, raindrops!\" And was that Willow's thoughtful \"Hmm\" coming from high above?",

As he rounded the corner by the old oak tree—the one with the friendly face in its bark—he found exactly who he expected to find. \"Oh no, oh no, my beautiful clover!\" Pip the rabbit was hopping in frantic circles around his burrow, like a furry whirlwind of worry. Purple clover flowers and bright green leaves were scattered everywhere—some already getting damp and soggy from the growing sprinkles of rain. \"Right then!\" said Bramble, rolling up his sleeves with determination. \"Let's race those raindrops!\" \"Ooh, ooh! Race you there!\" bounced Pip, his nose twitching with glee. And race they did! Bramble and Pip bounced and hopped and gathered clover faster than you could say \"Oh my paws and whiskers!\" But just as they got the very last armful to the burrow entrance—triumph!—Bramble noticed something. Some purple flowers had somehow gotten mixed in with the winter storage leaves, and some of the best green leaves were nestled in the snacking pile like they belonged there. \"Well... it's all inside and dry as a bone!\" said Pip. \"That's what matters most, right?\"",

You really think we should sort first, even with the storm coming closer and closer? That sounds like... well, not racing, but still quite fun in a different sort of way!\" So they sorted together—purple flowers in one neat pile for snacking (sweet as summer sunshine), green leaves in another tidy pile for winter storing (tough as little green umbrellas). It was slower than rushing, much slower, but as they worked with careful paws, they were actually talking, and Pip was telling him stories about where he'd found the very best clover. \"There!\" said Pip when they finished, looking at his two perfectly organized piles with pride shining in his bright eyes. \"This is much, much better than having everything jumbled together like socks in a drawer. Thank you for helping me slow down, Bramble!\"",

Soon they had gathered an enormous pile of materials—more than Willow had started with, much more! But when they tried to weave them together, quick-quick-quick, the same thing kept happening over and over.

Everyone should have what they need.\" But Bramble noticed that some of Hazel's own windows didn't have their storm shutters up yet. \"Have you had time to get your own den ready?\" Bramble asked gently. Hazel's ears drooped just a little. \"Well, I was planning to do that next, but I want to make sure everyone else is taken care of first.\" Bramble felt his heart full of all the lessons from today—sometimes fast like with Pip, sometimes slow like with Willow, and now... \"What would be the kindest thing to do?\" he wondered. \"Take care of the caretakers too,\" he realized.",
