# Enhanced Interactive Story Framework Template

## Overview
This framework provides a character-agnostic structure for creating interactive children's stories with branching narratives. The template ensures consistent pacing, decision point logic, and educational value while allowing complete flexibility in themes, characters, and settings.

## Core Story Architecture

### Scene-Based Structure (Aligned with Existing JSON Format)
- **Opening Scenes (2-3 scenes):** Character introduction, setting establishment, initial situation
- **Development Scenes (3-5 scenes):** Supporting character encounters, setup development
- **Decision Point 1 (1 scene):** First choice (A or B) - fundamental approach dichotomy
- **Branch A Journey (2-3 scenes):** Side journey based on DP1-A choice
- **Branch B Journey (2-3 scenes):** Side journey based on DP1-B choice  
- **Decision Point 2 (2 scenes):** Contextual versions based on DP1 (DP2-A and DP2-B), each with 2 choices
- **Combined Journey Scenes (3-4 scenes):** Side journeys based on DP1+DP2 combinations
- **Decision Point 3 (2 scenes):** Resolution versions grouping pathways by thematic effect
- **Ending Scenes (2-3 scenes):** Final pathways leading to themed resolutions

*Total: ~15-25 scenes - optimized for [TARGET_AGE_GROUP] engagement and digital interaction*

### Age-Specific Scene Count Guidelines
- **Ages 3-4:** 12-15 scenes (shorter pathways, simpler choices)
- **Ages 5-6:** 15-20 scenes (balanced complexity)
- **Ages 7-8:** 18-25 scenes (fuller narrative development)

## Decision Point Logic System

### Enhanced Pathway Mapping (Mapped to Scene IDs)

**DP1:** Choice A or B (fundamental approach dichotomy)
- Should represent a **core value choice** (e.g., "immediate action vs. careful planning")
- Must be **equally valid** options - no "right" or "wrong" choice
- Creates distinct **narrative tone** for subsequent scenes
- DP1-A path: scenes prefixed with "branch-a-"
- DP1-B path: scenes prefixed with "branch-b-"

**DP2:** Two contextual versions based on DP1 (DP2-A version, DP2-B version), each with 2 choices
- **Context-Dependent**: DP2-A choices should feel natural after choosing DP1-A
- **Meaningful Differentiation**: Each version should offer genuinely different dilemmas
- **Character Agency**: Child should feel ownership over both levels of choice
- Creates 4 possible pathways: 1A2A, 1A2B, 1B2A, 1B2B
- DP2 scenes: "dp2-a-choice", "dp2-b-choice" with subsequent paths "dp2-a-1", "dp2-a-2", "dp2-b-1", "dp2-b-2"

**DP3:** Three resolution versions that group pathways by thematic "net effect"
- **Version 1:** 1A2A (consistent approach in primary direction) → "ending-consistent-primary"
- **Version 2:** 1B2B (consistent approach in secondary direction) → "ending-consistent-secondary" 
- **Version 3:** 1A2B + 1B2A (balanced approaches = "integrated" version) → "ending-balanced"
- Each version should offer **distinct wisdom/learning** rather than just different outcomes

### Advanced Pathway Considerations
**Emotional Pacing**: Each pathway should have appropriate emotional ups and downs
**Character Growth**: {{childName}} should show clear development regardless of path chosen
**Supporting Character Arcs**: Major characters should have satisfying development across all pathways they appear in
**Thematic Consistency**: Each pathway should deliver on its promised theme/learning objective

## Enhanced Character Role Framework

### Core Character Roles with Video Call Optimization
- **[PROTAGONIST]:** Main character referenced as `{{childName}}` in text
  - Must have **clear motivation** that children can understand and relate to
  - Should demonstrate **age-appropriate problem-solving**
  - Voice should adapt to **different choice combinations** while staying consistent

- **[MENTOR_CHARACTER]:** Wise figure providing guidance and perspective
  - **Video Call Function**: Natural "discussion starter" - gives advice that reader can elaborate on
  - **Choice Integration**: Should react differently to child's decisions without judgment
  - **Learning Facilitation**: Helps child process consequences of choices

- **[ALLY_CHARACTER]:** Peer-level companion for collaboration and learning
  - **Relatability Factor**: Should feel like a friend the child might have
  - **Choice Support**: Can model different approaches or support child's decisions
  - **Engagement Hook**: Perfect for reader to "voice" in character during video calls

- **[CHALLENGE_CHARACTER]:** Character presenting obstacles and teaching resilience
  - **Age-Appropriate Conflict**: Should challenge child without being frightening
  - **Growth Catalyst**: Their challenges should lead to child's development
  - **Resolution Variety**: Should have different resolution styles across pathways

### Supporting Character Functions with Enhanced Specificity
- **Role 1 - The Enthusiast:** Energetic character who encourages immediate action (teaches about [COURAGE/SPONTANEITY])
- **Role 2 - The Thoughtful Guide:** Reflective character who promotes careful consideration (teaches about [WISDOM/PLANNING])
- **Role 3 - The Practical Helper:** Character focused on concrete problem-solving (teaches about [RESOURCEFULNESS/PERSISTENCE])
- **Role 4 - The Emotional Mirror:** Character who reflects and validates child's feelings (teaches about [EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE])

## Strengthened Thematic Framework Configuration

### Enhanced Learning Objective Structure
Configure these based on story theme with **specific behavioral outcomes**:

1. **[PRIMARY_DICHOTOMY]** 
   - Definition: Clear explanation of the core choice (e.g., "Individual vs. Community")
   - Child Application: How this applies to child's real life
   - Story Integration: How this plays out across all pathways
   - Discussion Prompts: Questions for video call conversation

2. **[SECONDARY_DICHOTOMY]** 
   - Relationship to Primary: How these choices interact (e.g., "Risk vs. Safety" within community context)
   - Complexity Appropriateness: Suitable for target age range
   - Character Embodiment: Which characters represent each side

3. **[INTEGRATION_LEARNING]** 
   - Synthesis Wisdom: What the "balanced" pathway teaches (e.g., "Creative Problem-Solving through Community")
   - Real-World Application: How child can use this learning
   - Growth Demonstration: How {{childName}} shows this learning in the story

### Enhanced Choice Value Configurations
Customize these choice pairs for your theme with **clear child language**:
- **[QUICK_CHOICE] vs. [CAREFUL_CHOICE]** ("Right away" vs. "Take time to think")
- **[INDEPENDENT_CHOICE] vs. [COLLABORATIVE_CHOICE]** ("Do it myself" vs. "Ask for help")
- **[DIRECT_CHOICE] vs. [CREATIVE_CHOICE]** ("The obvious way" vs. "Try something new")
- **[SAFE_CHOICE] vs. [BRAVE_CHOICE]** ("The safe way" vs. "The adventurous way")
