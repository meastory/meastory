### **Resolution Narrative**
Whether {{childName}} built fast then focused individually, or built carefully then shared generously, they've learned to **balance action with reflection**.

*Walter Wolf, come over here!*  
*You're great at huffing, that's so true—*  
*But what if we found work for you?"*
