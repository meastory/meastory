*"What?" asked {{childName}} softly.*

### **Ending Scene**:
*"You know what's amazing about today?" said {{childName}}, looking around at all three bears with bright, thoughtful eyes.*

*"What's amazing?" asked Baby Bear, practically bouncing with curiosity.*

*"We're all so different, but we made such wonderful friends! Papa Bear, you taught me that being big and strong means you can be extra gentle. Mama Bear, you showed me that being caring means noticing what everyone needs. And Baby Bear, you proved that being small means you can have the biggest heart of all!"*

*The bears looked at each other with new appreciation.*

*"And {{childName}}," added Papa Bear thoughtfully, "you taught us that friendship isn't about being the same - it's about celebrating what makes each friend special."*

*"Sometimes I was brave and bold," reflected {{childName}}, "and sometimes I was careful and quiet. Both ways helped me understand you better!"*

*Mama Bear nodded wisely. "That's the secret of the very best friendships - knowing when to speak up and when to listen, when to lead and when to follow."*

*"Let's make a friendship promise!" suggested Baby Bear excitedly. "We'll always help other children learn to make friends too!"*

*They all joined paws and hands in a circle. "We promise to share the magic of friendship!" they said together.*

*As {{childName}} headed home, the evening stars were twinkling. But the brightest light was the warm glow in {{childName}}'s heart - the glow that comes from learning that the best friendships celebrate everyone's different gifts.*
