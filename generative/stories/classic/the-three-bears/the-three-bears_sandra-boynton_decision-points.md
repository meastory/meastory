# Decision Point Design: The Three Bears Interactive Adventure

## 1. Decision Point 1 (Fundamental Approach)

### **Core Choice Structure**
**Story Context**: {{childName}} discovers the bears' cozy cottage in the woods

### **Choice A: The Respectful Explorer** ðŸšª
**Choice Language**: *"Should {{childName}} knock politely on the door and wait for someone to answer?"*

**Child-Friendly Framing**: *"Knock, knock, knock! 'Hello, is anyone home?' {{childName}} could say."*

**Approach Values**:
- Courtesy and patience
- Following social rules
- Seeking permission first
- Respecting boundaries

### **Choice B: The Curious Adventurer** ðŸ‘€
**Choice Language**: *"Should {{childName}} peek through the window to see what's inside first?"*

**Child-Friendly Framing**: *"Tip-toe, tip-toe! {{childName}} could take a little peek to see who might be home."*

**Approach Values**:
- Natural curiosity

- Cautious exploration
- Learning through observation

### **Underlying Dichotomy**: **Direct Communication vs. Careful Observation**
- **Not**: Right vs. Wrong
- **But**: Two different styles of approaching new situations
- **Both valid**: Respects different personality types and social comfort levels

### **Story Integration**
**Natural Narrative Placement**: The moment of discovering the cottage - exactly where the original Goldilocks faced the unlocked door

**Original Story Parallel**: 
- Original: Old woman looks in window, then enters uninvited
- **Adaptation**: Child chooses how to make contact appropriately

### **Age Appropriateness (3-8 years)**

#### **Ages 3-4**:
- **Choice A**: "Knock knock! Say hello!"
- **Choice B**: "Look and see who's there!"
- **Support**: Both framed as friendly, safe actions

#### **Ages 5-8**:
- **Choice A**: "Should {{childName}} use good manners and knock first?"
- **Choice B**: "Should {{childName}} be curious and peek inside first?"
- **Support**: Both presented as thoughtful approaches with different benefits
