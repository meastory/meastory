I've brought you treats!" (What a fib-fibber's grin!)

Tell me, dear child, where does she stay?
I'd love to visit some other day!"

That sneaky-sneak Wolf was flying above!
Well, not really flying, but running quite fast,
To Granny's house first - he'd beat them at last!

He crept-crept-crept with his trickiest grin,
"Let me inside! I have goodies within!"
He hid gentle Granny safe and sound,
Then put on her gown and laid himself down!

Observer of sounds and secret-keeper!

Maybe I told him a little too more.
I said where Granny lives down the hill,
Was that quite right? Was that quite still?"

The flowers were pretty in their small hand,
But slowly they started to understand:

Different from gentle and sweet and old."
But {{childName}} felt loving and wanted to care,
"I'll help her feel better when I get there!"

They opened the door just a little-bit wide,
And peeked at the figure on the bed inside.

"My heart tells me so, after all!
My Granny speaks softly, gentle and sweet,
But you're much too rumbly from head to feet!"

Just then came Keeper Peeper running around,
"What's all that rumbly-rumbly sound?"

Wolf sat up with wonder in his eyes,
"{{childName}} is clever! What a surprise!
You used smart thinking and feelings too,
There's no fooling someone as balanced as you!"

"I'm sorry-sorry for my silly game,
But watching you learn, I feel no shame!
You showed me that both ways are right-right-right,
When used together - what a sight!"
