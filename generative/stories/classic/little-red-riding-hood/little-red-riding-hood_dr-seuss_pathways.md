### **Detailed Scene Breakdown:**

**Opening-1: "The Mission"**
```
"{{childName}}, {{childName}}, what a fine day!
Your Granny is sick in her cottage today.
Mama has treats in a basket so neat,
With goodies and love, oh what a sweet treat!

'Take this to Granny,' Mama says with care,
'But stay on the path that will take you there.
Don't talk to strangers, don't wander away,
Follow the path and you'll be safe today.'"
```

**Opening-2: "The Journey Begins"**
```
"{{childName}} took the basket with pride,
'I'll help make Granny feel better!' they cried.
Off through the woods with a skip and a hop,
Following the path without a stop.

The woods were so pretty, the day was so bright,
Everything seemed to be perfectly right.
But what's that ahead? Oh my, what could it be?
A creature approaching... let's wait and see!"
```

**Opening-3: "The Wolf Appears"**
```
"Up came a Wolf with a smile so wide,
'Hello little one!' he called from the side.
'Where are you going with that basket so neat?
It looks like it's full of something to eat!'

{{childName}} remembered what Mama had said,
About talking to strangers... but the Wolf seemed well-bred.
'I'm going to Granny's,' {{childName}} replied,
'She's sick and needs treats,' they said with pride.

'Oh how lovely!' said Wolf with a grin,
'But look all around - what flowers within!
Pretty flowers grow here on the ground,
The most beautiful flowers that can be found!'"
```

**DP1-Choice: "The Path Decision"**
```
"The Wolf said, 'Those flowers would make Granny glad!
Without them, won't she be terribly sad?'
But Mama said clearly to stay on the path...
{{childName}} must choose - what comes after?"

A) "I'll stay on the path like Mama said!"
B) "I'll pick pretty flowers for Granny's bed!"
```

**Branch-A-1: "Following the Path" (Choice A selected)**
```
"'I'll follow the path,' said {{childName}} with care,
'Mama knows best about getting there.'
The Wolf looked surprised, then gave a small frown,
But {{childName}} walked on, safe and sound.

'That's a smart child,' the Wolf thought to himself,
'But I'll try a different trick, like a sneaky elf.'
He ran through the woods on a shortcut he knew,
While {{childName}} walked safely, as good children do."
```

**Branch-A-2: "Wolf's Head Start"**
```
"{{childName}} walked on the path, step by step,
While Wolf through the forest went hop, leap, and pep!
He got to Granny's before {{childName}} arrived,
And quickly a sneaky plan he contrived.

'I'll pretend to be {{childName}}!' he said with a grin,
He knocked on the door, 'Please let me come in!'
But {{childName}} was walking, careful and slow,
Following the path as good children should go."
```

**DP2-A-Choice: "Arrival Suspicions"**
```
"{{childName}} arrived at the cottage at last,
But something seemed different from when they'd walked past.
The door was wide open, that wasn't quite right,
And Granny's voice sounded... not quite so polite.

'Come in, my dear!' called a voice rough and deep,
But {{childName}} felt alert, not ready to sleep."

2A-1) "I'll look around carefully before I go in!"
2A-2) "I followed the path, so I'm ready to begin!"
```

**Journey-1A2A-1: "Careful Observation" (2A-1 selected)**
```
"{{childName}} stepped closer but looked all around,
'Something feels different,' they thought with a frown.
They peeked through the window with careful, smart eyes,
And got quite a shocking and big surprise!

There sat a Wolf in Granny's bed,
With Granny's night cap on his big head!
'That's not my Granny!' {{childName}} did think,
'His teeth are too sharp and his smile's too pink!'"
```

**Journey-1A2A-2: "Getting Help"**
```
"{{childName}} backed away, quiet as a mouse,
And ran to get help from the neighbor's house.
'Come quick!' they called, 'Something's not right!
My Granny needs help - what a terrible sight!'

The Helper Friend came with tools in hand,
'{{childName}}, your thinking was perfectly planned!
You stayed on the path and you watched with care,
Now let's help your Granny - we'll get her from there!'"
```

**DP3-Version-1: "Prepared Action"**
```
"{{childName}}, you've been so careful and smart!
You followed good rules right from the start.
Now you see clearly this Wolf's silly game,
How will you help? What will you claim?"

3-1A) "I'll help the Helper Friend save the day!"
3-1B) "I'll use my smart thinking in my own way!"
```

```
"{{childName}} thought, 'I followed the path with care,
So everything should be perfectly fair.'
They walked to the door with confident stride,
But stopped when they felt something funny inside.

'Hello, Granny!' they called out loud,
But the voice that answered made them feel... not proud.
'Come in, come in!' came a rumbly reply,
That made {{childName}} wonder... but why?"
```

### **Journey-1A2B-2: "Learning to Listen"**
```
"{{childName}} had followed the rules, that was true,
But now they felt something different and new.
'My tummy feels funny, my heart beats fast,
Maybe good rules and good feelings both last!'

They peeked in the door with their smart, careful eyes,
And gasped at what gave them such a surprise!
'That Wolf from the path! He's not my Granny!
His tricks are quite silly, but also quite canny!'"

```
"'I'll pick pretty flowers!' said {{childName}} with glee,
'They'll help make Granny as happy as can be!'
Off the path {{childName}} went with a bound,
To where the most beautiful flowers were found.

The Wolf smiled wide, 'What a kind little heart!
Tell me about Granny before we part.'
'She lives past the oak trees, under the hill,
In the cottage with roses on the windowsill.'"
```

### **Branch-B-2: "Generous Sharing"**
```
"{{childName}} picked flowers both yellow and red,
While thinking of Granny sick in her bed.
'These flowers will cheer her and make her smile,
Even if it takes me a little while.'

The Wolf said goodbye and ran down the lane,
While {{childName}} picked flowers in sunshine and rain.
With a beautiful bouquet, so bright and so neat,
{{childName}} headed off to make the day sweet."
```

### **DP2-B-Choice: "Growing Awareness"**
```
"{{childName}} arrived with flowers so bright,
But something at Granny's didn't seem right.

That made {{childName}}'s heart start to pound."

2B-1) "Maybe I should have been more careful today!"
2B-2) "Everything's fine, I just want to play!"
```

### **Journey-1B2A-1: "Learning from Experience" (2B-1 selected)**
```
"{{childName}} thought about the Wolf in the wood,
'Maybe telling him Granny's address wasn't good.'
They looked at the cottage with newly smart eyes,
And started to feel not so happy... but wise.

'I wanted to help, and that feeling was right,
But maybe I should have been more careful and bright.'
They crept to the window to peek and to see,
What could this strange situation be?"
```

### **Journey-1B2A-2: "Heart-Smart Discovery"**
```
"{{childName}} peeked in with their flowers held tight,
And saw something that gave them quite a fright!
The Wolf from the woods sat in Granny's place,
With Granny's nightcap on his furry face!

'I shared too much, but now I know better,
My heart was kind, now my head's getting wetter!'
With flowers still clutched in their small, gentle hand,
{{childName}} made a new, smarter plan."
```

### **Distinct Narrative Elements vs. 1A→2B:**
- **Different Starting Point**: Compassionate motivation vs. rule-based
- **Different Learning Arc**: Experience-based wisdom vs. intuitive development

```
"{{childName}} smiled at the cottage so neat,
'Granny's voice sounds different, but that's kind of sweet!
She must have a cold, that would make sense to me,
I'll give her these flowers and we'll have our tea!'

They walked to the door with their heart full of love,
And flowers as pretty as stars up above.
'I'm here with flowers!' they called with delight,
'To help make you feel better and make everything right!'"
```

### **Journey-1B2B-2: "Heart-Guided Recognition"**
```
"{{childName}} stepped in the cottage with care,
But something felt different in the air.
Not scary or bad, just... not quite the same,
Their loving heart told them this wasn't a game.

'Hello, my dear!' said the voice from the bed,
But {{childName}}'s heart said, 'Something's different,' instead.
With flowers still bright in their small, gentle hand,
They looked with love, trying to understand."
```

### **DP3-Version-2: "Heart-Smart Action"**

But now you can see that something is wrong!
Your caring for Granny can help save the day,
How will your kindness now show you the way?"
