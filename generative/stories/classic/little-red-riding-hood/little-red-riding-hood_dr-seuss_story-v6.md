While Wolf through the bushes went sneak, creep, and pep.

"Who's there?" called Granny's weak, gentle voice.
"It's {{childName}}, Granny!" the Wolf fibbed with glee,
"I've brought you treats - please let me in, please!"

Poor Granny opened the door with care,
But Wolf swooshed in with a wolfish glare!
"Don't worry," he said, "I'll keep you safe,
Just hide in here while I... er... play a game!"

"What a kind heart!" purred the Wolf with delight,
"Your Granny is lucky - you're such a sweet sight!
Tell me, dear child, where does she stay?
I'd love to visit her some other day!"

"She lives past the oak trees, down the hill,
In the cottage with roses by the windowsill!"

But while {{childName}} picked with love and care,
That sneaky-sneak Wolf was already there!
He crept to poor Granny with his trickiest grin,
"Let me inside - I have goodies within!"

He hid gentle Granny safe away from sight,
Then put on her gown - "This plan is just right!"
The bed creaked and groaned as he climbed on top,
"Now for {{childName}} - they'll get quite a shock!"

"Come in, come in!" called a rumbly sound,
Much deeper than Granny's voice, soft and round.

"Hello, Granny!" they called. "Are you alright?"

Much louder than Granny had been before.
{{childName}} looked at their flowers so neat,
Then thought of the Wolf they chanced to meet.

"I told that Wolf where Granny stays...
Was that okay? In how many ways
Could that be fine? Or should I worry?
Maybe I should not be in a hurry..."

Maybe I should think about his suggestions.
I told him exactly where Granny lives,
Was that too much? Should I not give?"

Their flowers were pretty, still bright in hand,

"Granny sounds... deeper, like she has a bad cold,
Her voice is quite different from gentle and old."
But {{childName}} felt loving and wanted to care,
"I'll help her feel better when I get in there!"

They opened the door just a little bit wide,
And peeked at the figure on the bed inside.

"You're NOT my Granny!" they said, standing tall,
"My heart tells me so, after all!
My Granny speaks softly, gentle and sweet,
But you're much too rumbly from head to feet!"

Just then came Keeper Peeper running around,
