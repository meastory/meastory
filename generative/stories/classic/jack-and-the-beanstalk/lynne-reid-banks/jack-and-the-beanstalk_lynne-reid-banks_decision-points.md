# Decision Points Framework: {{childName}} & Jack's Beanstalk Adventure

---

## 1. Decision Point 1 (Fundamental Approach)

### **Story Integration Point**: After discovering the magic beans but before climbing the beanstalk

**Narrative Setup**:
> "{{childName}} and Jack stood before the enormous beanstalk that had grown overnight. It stretched up and up until it disappeared into the clouds. Jack turned to {{childName}} with eyes full of wonder. 'This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen! What do you think we should do?'"

### **Choice A: EXPLORE TOGETHER** (Collaborative Adventure)
**Choice Language**: *"Let's climb up right now and see what's there together!"*
**Approach**: Immediate shared exploration driven by curiosity and mutual support

### **Choice B: PREPARE CAREFULLY** (Thoughtful Planning)  
**Choice Language**: *"Let's tell your mother and make a plan before we climb."*
**Approach**: Careful preparation with adult guidance and strategic thinking

### **Underlying Dichotomy: SPONTANEITY vs. PREPARATION**
- **Core Values Represented**:
  - **Choice A**: Trust in friendship, learning through experience, embracing wonder
  - **Choice B**: Respect for wisdom, careful planning, considering consequences
- **Age Appropriateness**: Both approaches are valuable life skills children need to develop
- **Equal Validity**: Neither choice is "wrong" - both lead to successful but different adventures

### **Banks-Style Presentation**:
> "{{childName}} felt their heart flutter with excitement and just a tiny bit of worry. There were two ways they could handle this magical moment, and both felt important in different ways."

**Choice 2A-1: KNOCK POLITELY** 
*"Let's knock on the door and introduce ourselves properly."*

**Choice 2A-2: PEEK AND OBSERVE**

**Context**: {{childName}} and Jack have told Mother, packed supplies, and climbed up together
**Secondary Choice Setup**:
> "With Mother's blessing and their small pack of supplies, {{childName}} and Jack reached the giant's house. They felt ready for anything. 'We planned so well,' said Jack. 'Now, how should we use what we've learned?'"

**Choice 2B-1: USE MOTHER'S ADVICE**
*"Let's remember what your mother said about being polite to strangers."*

**Choice 2B-2: TRUST OUR SUPPLIES**
*"Let's use the special things we brought to help us."*

### **Choice Logic & Character Development**

- **A-path choices**: Build on spontaneous courage, learning social skills through experience

### **Consequence Framework** (Banks-Style Gentle Learning)

**Positive Natural Outcomes**:
- All choices lead to growth and success, just through different paths
- Mistakes become learning opportunities shared between friends
- Each pathway validates the child's natural personality and thinking style

**Sample Consequence Language**:
> "{{childName}} discovered something wonderful about themselves that day. When they chose to [specific choice], it led to exactly the kind of adventure that felt right for them. And the best part was sharing it all with their dear friend Jack."

### **Video Call Discussion Opportunities**

**DP1 Discussion Starters**:
- *"{{childName}}, when you face something new and exciting, do you like to jump in or make a plan first?"*
- *"What do you think Jack is feeling right now?"*
- *"Have you ever had to make a choice like this with a friend?"*

**DP2 Discussion Starters**:
- *"How do you think {{childName}} and Jack are feeling about meeting someone new?"*
- *"What would you do if you found yourself in a place you'd never been before?"*
- *"What's the best way to make friends with someone very different from you?"*

**DP3 Discussion Starters**:
- *"{{childName}} has grown so much! What new things have they learned about themselves?"*
- *"How did working with Jack help {{childName}} solve problems?"*
- *"What would you tell {{childName}} about their adventure?"*

### **Age-Specific Adaptations**

**Ages 3-5 Focus**:
- Emphasize emotional safety and friendship support
- Simpler choice language focused on feelings
- More reassurance about outcomes

**Ages 6-8 Enhancement**:
- Add strategic thinking elements
- Include cause-and-effect discussions
- Encourage prediction and planning skills

### **Banks-Style Educational Philosophy Integration**

**Gentle Discovery Learning**:
- Children learn through experiencing consequences, not being told lessons
- Each choice validates different personality types and thinking styles
- Growth happens naturally through story experience rather than explicit teaching
- Adult readers can facilitate discussion without prescriptive guidance

**Sample Integration Example**:
> "As {{childName}} made their choice, they felt a little flutter of excitement in their chest. They were learning something important about themselves—something that would help them in many adventures to come. And the wonderful thing was, no matter what they chose, Jack would be right there beside them, learning too."

This framework ensures that each decision point builds naturally on the previous one while offering meaningful choice differentiation that respects different personality types and problem-solving approaches, all wrapped in Lynne Reid Banks' gentle, supportive narrative style.
