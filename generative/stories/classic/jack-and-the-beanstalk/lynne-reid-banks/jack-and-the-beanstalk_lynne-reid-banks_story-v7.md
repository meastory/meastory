**Primary Function**: Exposition - character and problem establishment

**Text**:
Once, when {{childName}} was visiting their very best friend Jack on a quiet morning, they noticed something troubling. Jack's mother sat by the window with worry lines around her gentle eyes, and their cow Milky-White stood unusually still in the yard.

"What's wrong, Jack?" asked {{childName}} softly, settling beside their friend on the wooden steps.

Jack sighed, a sound much too heavy for such a young heart. "Milky-White hasn't given any milk for three days now, {{childName}}. Mother says we might have to... to sell her." Jack's voice grew smaller. "But she's not just our cow. She's our friend."

{{childName}} felt their own heart flutter with concern. Jack's family had always been kind to them, sharing warm bread and gentle smiles. Now they needed help, and {{childName}} wanted very much to find a way to provide it.

"There must be something we can do," said {{childName}}, reaching for Jack's hand. "Good friends help each other figure out solutions."

**Position**: Inciting incident  
**Primary Function**: Exposition - mysterious helper introduction

**Text**:
As {{childName}} and Jack walked slowly toward the market with Milky-White, wondering what they could possibly do, they met the most unusual person on the path.

He was neither young nor old, with eyes that seemed to hold secrets and a small leather pouch that jingled softly as he walked. When he saw the children and their cow, he smiled in a way that made {{childName}} think of warm sunshine after rain.

"Good morning, Jack and {{childName}}," he said, though neither child remembered telling him their names.

Jack blinked in surprise. "Good morning, sir. How did you know who we are?"

The Bean Seller chuckled gently. "Ah, I know many things about children with caring hearts. I can see that you two are facing quite a puzzle today." His eyes twinkled as he looked at Milky-White. "Sometimes the most magical things look quite ordinary at first glance. What do you think magic really looks like?"

From his jingling pouch, he drew out a handful of beans that seemed to shimmer slightly in the morning light. "These," he said softly, "are very special beans. These beans... they respond to hearts that truly care."

**Position**: Initial challenge/choice setup  
**Primary Function**: Exposition - establishing stakes

**Text**:
The Bean Seller held the shimmering beans in his open palm, and {{childName}} felt something flutter in their chest—part excitement, part curiosity, and just a tiny bit of uncertainty.

"These beans," continued the kind stranger, "grow into something quite remarkable when planted by children who truly care about helping others. If you plant them tonight, by morning you'll discover something that could change everything."

Jack looked at {{childName}} with hopeful eyes. "What do you think? Should we trust in a little magic?"

{{childName}} studied the Bean Seller's gentle face and the unusual beans that seemed almost to glow with their own light. This felt like one of those moments when everything could change—but change in which direction?

"If the beans don't do what you say," Jack asked carefully, "could we have Milky-White back?"

"The choice is yours, young ones," said the Bean Seller with his mysterious smile. "Trust what your heart tells you. If magic doesn't happen by tomorrow morning, I will find you and return your dear cow myself." His eyes grew even more twinkly. "But I have a feeling that won't be necessary."

{{childName}} felt the weight of this important decision. Jack was looking to them for guidance, and whatever they decided together would shape their next adventure.

**Text**:
The trade was made with handshakes and gentle smiles. {{childName}} and Jack returned home with the magical beans, hearts full of hope and just a whisper of worry about what Jack's mother might say.

As expected, Mother was not immediately pleased. "Magical beans?" she said, her voice rising with concern. "Oh, my dear children, how could you trade our Milky-White for a handful of beans?" But even as she worried, {{childName}} could see the love in her eyes. "{{childName}}, my dear one, I know your heart wants to help. Sometimes the most ordinary days can hold the most extraordinary surprises, but..."

That evening, after Mother had calmed and Jack had planted the beans in the garden with {{childName}}'s help, they all went to bed wondering what the morning might bring.

But when {{childName}} woke up and looked out Jack's window, they gasped with pure amazement.

The beans had grown into an enormous beanstalk that stretched up and up and up until it disappeared into the fluffy white clouds above. It was the most magnificent thing {{childName}} had ever seen—thick as a tree trunk, with leaves as big as dinner plates and sturdy stems that looked almost like a ladder reaching to the sky.

Jack appeared beside {{childName}} at the window, his eyes as round as saucers. "{{childName}}," he whispered, "do you see what I see?"

{{childName}} felt their heart beating with excitement and wonder. The Bean Seller had been right—magic was real, and it was growing right outside their window.

{{childName}} and Jack stood before the amazing beanstalk, feeling the morning breeze rustle through its enormous leaves. This was clearly the most extraordinary thing that had ever happened to either of them.

"{{childName}}," said Jack, his voice filled with wonder and just a touch of nervous excitement, "what do you think we should do? This beanstalk goes all the way up to the clouds, and I can't help but wonder what might be up there."

{{childName}} looked up at the beanstalk stretching endlessly upward, then at their best friend's hopeful face. This felt like one of those moments when the choice they made would shape their entire adventure.

The beanstalk looked sturdy and climbable, with thick stems that would make perfect handholds. Part of {{childName}} wanted to start climbing right away to see what wonderful things awaited them above the clouds. But another part wondered if they should be more careful and tell Jack's mother about their discovery first.

"I think," said Jack thoughtfully, "that we could handle this in two different ways, and both might lead to amazing adventures."

Jack's face lit up with a smile as bright as the morning sun. "I was hoping you'd say that! I feel so much braver when we're together."

With hearts full of courage and curiosity, {{childName}} and Jack began to climb. The beanstalk was even sturdier than it looked, with thick stems that made perfect handholds and broad leaves that offered little resting spots along the way.

"This is incredible!" called {{childName}} as they climbed higher and higher. "Look how small everything looks down below!"

"And look how big everything looks up above!" Jack called back, pointing toward the clouds that grew closer with every step they took.

They climbed and they climbed, encouraging each other with cheerful words and shared excitement. {{childName}} felt proud of their choice to be adventurous, and especially proud to be sharing this magical experience with their very best friend.

As {{childName}} and Jack climbed through the soft, white clouds, they emerged into the most amazing world they had ever imagined.

Everything was enormous! The grass beneath their feet was as tall as they were, and flowers bloomed in colors that seemed brighter and more beautiful than any flowers in their own garden. In the distance, they could see a magnificent house that looked like a castle, but bigger than any castle in any story they'd ever heard.

"{{childName}}," whispered Jack in wonder, "do you think giants might live here?"

{{childName}} felt a little flutter in their stomach—part excitement, part nervousness, and lots of curiosity. "If they do," said {{childName}} thoughtfully, "I hope they're friendly giants. Maybe they're just really big people who could become really big friends."

As they walked through the giant-sized world, {{childName}} felt grateful for their choice to explore together. Everything felt more manageable and more magical when shared with Jack. Their spontaneous decision to climb immediately had led them to this incredible discovery, and they felt proud of their adventurous spirits.

In the distance, they could see smoke rising from the chimney of the enormous house. Someone was definitely home.

{{childName}} felt the importance of this moment settling in their heart. "Jack, this is the most amazing thing that's ever happened to us. I think we should tell your mother first and make sure we're really ready for whatever we might find up there."

Jack nodded thoughtfully. "You're right, {{childName}}. Mother always says that the best adventures are the ones you're prepared for. And besides, she should know where we're going!"

Together, they hurried back into the house to find Jack's mother tending the fire. When she saw the enormous beanstalk through the window, her eyes grew as wide as dinner plates.

"Oh my stars!" she exclaimed. "Those beans truly were magical! But children, you mustn't think of climbing such a thing without proper preparation."

{{childName}} felt warm satisfaction at their choice to include Jack's mother. She immediately began gathering things they might need: a small pack with bread and water, a warm shawl in case it was cold above the clouds, and most importantly, her blessing and advice.

"If you meet anyone up there," she said gently, "remember to be polite and respectful. Sometimes the most unexpected people become the kindest friends."

With their small pack secured and Mother's wise words fresh in their hearts, {{childName}} and Jack began their carefully planned climb up the magical beanstalk.

{{childName}} felt different about this climb than they might have felt about a spontaneous one. There was something deeply satisfying about being prepared, about knowing they had everything they needed and everyone who loved them knew where they were going.

"I'm glad we took time to get ready," said Jack as they climbed steadily upward. "Mother's advice always helps me feel more confident."

"And the bread smells wonderful," added {{childName}}, patting their pack. "If we meet anyone up there, we'll have something nice to share."

As they climbed through the clouds, {{childName}} reflected on how good it felt to make thoughtful decisions. Their choice to prepare carefully hadn't made the adventure any less exciting—it had made it feel safer and more intentional.

When they emerged above the clouds into the giant world, they were ready. Ready to be polite, ready to be respectful, and ready to handle whatever they might discover with wisdom and kindness.

The enormous house in the distance looked just as magnificent as it would have if they'd arrived unprepared, but now {{childName}} felt confident they could approach it thoughtfully.

As {{childName}} and Jack approached the enormous house, they could hear sounds from inside—the gentle humming of someone working, and the soft footsteps of someone very, very large.

Jack looked at {{childName}} with eyes full of curiosity and just a flutter of nervousness. "We came up here so boldly, {{childName}}, and it's been wonderful so far. But now that we're here, how do you think we should meet whoever lives in this amazing house?"

{{childName}} considered their options carefully. Their adventurous climb had brought them this far, and now they had to decide how to approach this next part of their adventure.

Through the enormous windows, they could see the shadow of someone moving around inside—someone very tall but moving with gentle, careful motions. The house itself looked tidy and welcoming, with flower boxes in the giant-sized windows and a well-worn path to the front door.

"I think," said {{childName}} thoughtfully, "we could either go right up and knock on the door to introduce ourselves, or we could watch quietly for a little while first to learn more about who lives here."

Jack nodded. "Both ways could lead to making friends, couldn't they? Just in different styles."

{{childName}} felt the pleasant weight of decision-making. What felt right for this moment in their adventure?

"{{childName}}," said Jack thoughtfully, "we prepared so well for this moment. Mother gave us such good advice, and we brought thoughtful gifts too. How do you think we should introduce ourselves?"

{{childName}} felt the satisfying weight of their small pack and remembered Mother's gentle words about being polite and respectful to strangers. They had climbed up here with such good preparation, and now they could choose how to make the best first impression.

Through the giant-sized windows, they could see someone moving about inside—someone very large but moving with careful, gentle motions. The warm smell of baking bread drifted out through an open window, mixing with the scent of flowers from the enormous garden.

"I think," said {{childName}} after a moment of thought, "we could either go right up and introduce ourselves the way your mother taught us, or we could give our special gifts first to show what kind of visitors we are."

Jack smiled. "Either way, we'll be using our preparation thoughtfully, won't we? We're ready for both!"

{{childName}} nodded, feeling confident about their choice to plan ahead. Now they could decide exactly how to put that planning to good use.

**Choices**:
- **Choice 2B-1**: "Let's introduce ourselves politely, just like your mother taught us." (→ `journey-1b2a-1`)

For a moment, there was surprised silence. Then the door opened, and there stood the tallest, kindest-looking woman {{childName}} had ever seen. She had gentle eyes and flour on her apron, and her face lit up with the most delighted smile.

"Oh my stars, what a brave little one you are!" she exclaimed, clapping her enormous hands together. "Real children! How absolutely wonderful! I'm Mrs. Giantess, and I haven't had such delightful visitors in years and years!"

{{childName}} felt proud of their bold choice. Their direct, friendly approach had created exactly the kind of warm welcome they had hoped for.

"Come quickly, dear children," she said with conspiratorial kindness. "I was just baking bread, and I have so many questions about your beanstalk adventure! You have such clever minds, both of you!"

{{childName}} felt warm happiness spreading through their chest. Their choice to be bold and direct had not only gained them entry to this magical place, but had earned them the friendship of someone who truly appreciated their adventurous spirits.

"Mrs. Giantess," said {{childName}} curiously, "do you live here all by yourself? This house is so big and beautiful, but it seems like it might be lonely sometimes."

Mrs. Giantess's eyes grew soft and a little sad. "Well, my husband lives here too, but he gets ever so grumbly, and he's not used to having small visitors. I do get rather lonely for friendly conversation and cheerful company."

Jack reached over and patted Mrs. Giantess's enormous hand with his small one. "We're here now, and we'd love to be your friends!"

{{childName}} nodded enthusiastically. Their adventurous choice to climb immediately and knock boldly had led them to someone who truly needed friendship.

{{childName}} felt their heart beat a little faster, but not with fear—with excitement. Their adventurous journey had led them to this moment, and they felt confident that their bold, friendly approach would serve them well.

"Don't worry, Mrs. Giantess," said {{childName}} warmly. "We're getting quite good at making new friends. Maybe your husband just needs to meet some children who aren't afraid of him."

Jack nodded bravely. "If he sees how much we enjoy spending time with you, maybe he'll want to be friends too!"

The footsteps grew closer, and they could hear a deep voice muttering to itself: "Fe-fi-fo-fum, something smells different in my home today..."

Mrs. Giantess looked at {{childName}} and Jack with admiring eyes. "You two are the bravest, kindest children I've ever met. Your friendship has already made this day brighter than it's been in months."

For just a moment, {{childName}} felt a flutter of nervousness. This was definitely the biggest person they had ever met! But then they noticed something wonderful: the Giant's eyes were kind, just like his wife's, and when he saw Mrs. Giantess smiling so happily, his gruff expression began to soften.

"Fe-fi-fo-fum," he said in his deep, rumbling voice, but with wonder rather than anger. "I smell the scent of adventure and friendship in our home today! Wife, what wonderful thing has happened while I was walking?"

{{childName}} felt their courage returning in full force. The Giant's voice was booming but curious, not threatening at all. Their adventurous, friendly approach had worked with Mrs. Giantess, and {{childName}} felt ready to try the same warmth with her husband.

"He's so big!" whispered Jack, but with excitement rather than fear. "And did you hear? He sounds puzzled, not angry!"

{{childName}} felt their adventurous spirit combining with a new sense of wisdom. "Let's watch quietly first, Jack. Even though we climbed up boldly, maybe we can be thoughtful about how we meet whoever lives here."

Jack nodded approvingly. "That's a good idea, {{childName}}. We can be both brave and smart!"

Hidden behind an enormous flower pot, {{childName}} and Jack watched the giant house carefully. Through the kitchen window, they could see a very tall woman with a kind face kneading bread dough with gentle, practiced motions. She hummed softly as she worked, and her movements were careful and graceful despite her size.

"She looks so kind," whispered {{childName}}, "and she seems to love baking. I wonder if she gets lonely in such a big house."

After watching for a while, they saw an enormous man approaching the house from the garden. Instead of looking scary, he looked tired, and when he saw his wife through the window, his gruff expression softened into a small smile.

"{{childName}}," whispered Jack, "they both seem nice, just very big. And I think the lady might enjoy having visitors to bake for."

{{childName}} felt proud of their choice to observe first. Their bold adventure had brought them here, but taking time to watch and learn was giving them valuable information about how to approach these new potential friends.

Mrs. Giantess looked up with delighted surprise. "Oh my goodness! Real children! And such polite ones too!" She wiped her floury hands on her apron and beamed down at them. "I'm Mrs. Giantess, and I do love baking!"

{{childName}} felt happy about their choice to watch first and then be friendly. "We saw how much you enjoy baking, Mrs. Giantess. It looked like you were having fun!"

"We thought you might like having visitors to share your wonderful bread with," added Jack with a smile.

"Oh," said Mrs. Giantess with a little worry, "my husband is returning. He's not unkind, but he does get surprised by unexpected visitors."

{{childName}} felt a calm confidence settling in their heart. Their journey had taught them to combine bold action with thoughtful planning, and they felt ready for this challenge.

"Mrs. Giantess," said {{childName}} thoughtfully, "we noticed when we were watching that your husband's face gets gentle when he looks at you. Maybe if he sees how happy our friendship makes you, he'll understand that we're good visitors to have."

Jack nodded wisely. "And we could tell him about our beanstalk adventure. Everyone seems to enjoy hearing about adventures!"

Mrs. Giantess looked at them with growing amazement. "You children are not only brave enough to climb magical beanstalks and kind enough to make friends with giants, you're also wise enough to think about the best ways to help everyone feel comfortable. How remarkable!"

The footsteps paused outside the door, and they heard that familiar deep voice: "Fe-fi-fo-fum, I sense something wonderful has happened in our home today..."

{{childName}} felt ready to meet this final challenge with all the wisdom and courage their adventure had taught them.

For just a moment, {{childName}} felt both amazed and a tiny bit nervous. But then they remembered everything their journey had taught them about combining courage with wisdom, and they looked closely at the Giant's face.

Just as they had observed earlier, his eyes were kind, and when he saw his wife's happy expression, his puzzled frown began to transform into curious interest.

"Fe-fi-fo-fum," he said in his deep, wondering voice, "I smell something different in our home today—something that makes my dear wife smile more brightly than I've seen in months!"

{{childName}} felt their balanced approach settling into place perfectly. They had learned to be both adventurous and thoughtful, and this felt like exactly the right moment to use both qualities.

"He sounds curious, not angry," whispered Jack with growing confidence. "And look how he notices that Mrs. Giantess is happy!"

Together, they walked up to the enormous front door. {{childName}} took a deep breath, remembering Mother's words about treating all people with kindness, and knocked with polite firmness.

{{childName}} felt wonderful about following Mother's guidance to be completely honest. "Jack's mother taught us that real friendship starts with truthfulness. She helped us pack this bread to share because she said that's how you show you come as friends, not just as curious visitors."

Mrs. Giantess's eyes grew soft with emotion. "What wise guidance from such a caring mother! And what thoughtful children you are to follow her advice so well. You know, I haven't had such genuine, honest friendship in years. I do get rather lonely for friendly conversation."
