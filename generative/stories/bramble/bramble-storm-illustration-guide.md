## Illustration Style Notes

### Overall Aesthetic
- **Julia Donaldson Style**: Warm, inviting watercolor-style illustrations

- **Weather Progression**: Storm builds dramatically but never frightening - more exciting than scary
- **Character Expressions**: Always kind, even when worried or tired

### Consistent Elements Throughout
- **Bramble's scarf**: Blue scarf should be visible in every scene, its condition reflecting his emotional state (neat when calm, twisted when worried)
- **Weather progression**: Storm builds from first drops to steady rain to clearing
- **Woodland details**: Consistent tree shapes, burrow styles, woodland paths
- **Character positioning**: Show relationships through proximity and body language

### Technical Considerations
- **Age-appropriate**: Nothing scary or overwhelming for 3-8 year olds
- **Visual clarity**: Each choice option should be subtly suggested in illustration composition
- **Character consistency**: Same design throughout all scenes
- **Environmental storytelling**: Background details support narrative progression
