# Development Request: Enhanced Story JSON Format Implementation

## Overview

We are upgrading our story JSON format to better support our core use case of video call storytelling between family members. The enhanced format adds educational framework, video call optimization, and improved content management while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing narrative structure.

## Current vs. Enhanced Format Comparison

### Current Format (Minimal)
```json
{
  "id": "story-id",
  "title": "Story Title", 
  "ageRange": [3, 8],
  "themes": ["theme1", "theme2"],
  "scenes": [...]
}
```

### Enhanced Format (Full)
```json
{
  "id": "story-id",
  "title": "{{childName}} Story Title",
  "ageRange": [3, 8],
  "estimatedReadTime": "8-12 minutes",
  "themes": ["theme1", "theme2"],
  "learningObjectives": [...],
  "discussionPrompts": [...],
  "scenes": [...], // Enhanced with emotionalBeat, readAloudNotes
  "pathways": {...}, // New pathway metadata
  "videoCallOptimization": {...}, // New video call features  
  "characters": {...}, // New character profiles
  "backgrounds": {...} // New illustration guidance
}
```

## URGENT: Core Compatibility Updates

- Add default values for missing optional fields
- Update validation schema to accept both old and new formats

**Fields to Add:**
```typescript
interface StorySchema {
  // Existing required fields (unchanged)
  id: string;
  title: string;
  ageRange: [number, number];
  themes: string[];
  scenes: Scene[];
  
  // New optional fields
  estimatedReadTime?: string;
  learningObjectives?: string[];
  discussionPrompts?: string[];
  pathways?: PathwayInfo;
  videoCallOptimization?: VideoCallData;
  characters?: CharacterProfiles;
  backgrounds?: BackgroundData;
}
```

#### 1.2 Enhanced Scene Schema Support
**Priority: Critical**  
**Effort: 1 day**

Update scene parsing to handle new optional scene fields:

```typescript
interface Scene {
  // Existing required fields (unchanged)
  id: string;
  background: string;
  text: string;
  choices: Choice[];
  
  // New optional fields
  emotionalBeat?: string;
  readAloudNotes?: string;
}

interface Choice {
  // Existing fields (unchanged)
  label: string;
  nextSceneId: string;
  
  // New optional field
  choiceType?: string;
}
```

- Support pronoun replacement (they/them/their) based on child name
- Add validation to ensure all {{childName}} instances are properly replaced
- Handle title updates (e.g., "{{childName}} Bear and the Coming Storm")

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface NameReplacementConfig {
  childName: string;
  pronouns?: {
    subject: string;    // they
    object: string;     // them  
    possessive: string; // their
  };
}

function enhancedNameReplacement(story: Story, config: NameReplacementConfig): Story;
```
