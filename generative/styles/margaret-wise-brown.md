## Margaret Wise Brown Style Guide

### Core Stylistic Elements

#### **Rhythm & Flow**
- **Meter Pattern**: Gentle, soothing, and rhythmic—often mimicking the natural cadence of lullabies or the gentle flow of bedtime routines.
- **Line Length**: Short to medium sentences; often grouped into poetic stanzas or repeated structures, making the text easy to follow for young listeners.
- **Pace**: Steady and comforting, with occasional subtle builds in excitement or curiosity, then returning to calm.
- **Breath Points**: Clear natural pauses at the end of lines or repeated phrases, ideal for read-alouds and listener anticipation.

#### **Language Characteristics**
- **Vocabulary Level**: Simple, concrete, and accessible, with careful selection of words that young children can understand and relate to their own experiences.
- **Sentence Structure**: 
  - Typical sentence length: 5–12 words.
  - Complexity: Mostly simple and compound sentences; complexity arises from repetition and variation rather than syntactic intricacy.
  - Variety: High reliance on repetitive patterns (refrains, parallel structures), with subtle variations to maintain interest.
- **Word Choice**: Concrete, sensory, and emotional—focused on everyday objects, animals, and natural phenomena. Playful without being silly.
- **Made-up Words**: Occasional, always with clear context (e.g., “goodnight nobody”).

#### **Repetitive Elements**
- **Refrains**: Exact repeated phrases are signature (e.g., “goodnight moon, goodnight cow jumping over the moon”). These provide predictability and comfort.
- **Structural Repetition**: Parallel sentence structures and recurring patterns (e.g., “In the great green room...”).
- **Sound Patterns**: Subtle rhyme, alliteration, and assonance; not strict or sing-song, but musical and soothing.
- **Rhythm Patterns**: Consistent, gentle meter with occasional call-and-response or echo effects.

#### **Narrative Voice**
- **Perspective**: Usually third person, observational, with occasional gentle direct address to the reader/listener.
- **Tone**: Warm, gentle, reassuring, and sometimes quietly adventurous.
- **Relationship to Reader**: Inclusive, creating a sense of safety and belonging; the child is often implicitly or explicitly invited into the story world.
- **Emotional Range**: Consistent warmth and calm, with subtle shifts to curiosity or wonder, always returning to comfort.

#### **Story Structure Preferences**
- **Opening Style**: Begins by anchoring the child in a familiar, comforting setting (e.g., a room, a garden, a house at night).
- **Problem Introduction**: Challenges are gentle, often curiosity- or exploration-driven rather than conflict-based.
- **Resolution Style**: Solutions are calm, affirming, and often involve returning to safety or routine.
- **Ending Patterns**: Circular—often returning to the starting point, providing closure and a sense of completion.

#### **Character Voice Patterns**
- **Dialogue Style**: Minimal direct dialogue; when present, it’s simple and childlike.
- **Internal Thoughts**: Rarely explicit; emotions and thoughts are shown through actions and descriptions.
- **Character Interactions**: Supportive and gentle; characters (human, animal, or object) coexist peacefully.
- **Child Agency**: Medium—children are often observers or gentle explorers, learning through experience and curiosity.

- **Consequence Description**: Describe outcomes simply and concretely, mirroring the calm, observational style: “When {{childName}} chose to look under the blanket, there was a sleepy kitten waiting.”
- **Moral Integration**: Lessons are implicit, discovered through gentle exploration and natural consequences, not didactic.

#### **Personalization Elements**

- **Child Involvement**: Encourage observation, gentle decision-making, and sensory exploration.
