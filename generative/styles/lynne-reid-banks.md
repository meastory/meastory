## Author Style Guide: Lynne Reid Banks

#### **Core Stylistic Elements**

**Rhythm & Flow**  
- **Meter Pattern**: Gentle, with a natural storytelling cadence—neither strictly poetic nor overly formal, but with a subtle musicality that supports read-aloud clarity.  
- **Line Length**: Medium sentences, often broken into clauses for clarity, with occasional shorter bursts for emphasis or variety.  
- **Pace**: Steady and comforting, with moments of gentle acceleration during action or discovery.  
- **Breath Points**: Pauses at clause boundaries and after significant revelations, allowing listeners (and readers) to absorb developments.

**Language Characteristics**  
- **Vocabulary Level**: Mixed simple-complex—accessible for young children, but with occasional richer words to stretch understanding, always in clear context.  
- **Sentence Structure**:  
  - Typical sentence length: 8–15 words  
  - Complexity: Compound and complex, but always clear; avoids convoluted syntax.  
  - Variety: Mix of sentence lengths and structures, avoiding monotonous repetition.  
- **Word Choice**: Concrete and sensory, with a focus on tangible details; emotional language is understated but present. Made-up words are rare, and when used, their meaning is immediately clear from context.  

**Repetitive Elements**  
- **Refrains**: Occasional repeated phrases for emphasis, especially at key story moments, but not as a structural device.  
- **Structural Repetition**: Subtle—more about returning to a theme or idea than repeating exact sentences.  
- **Sound Patterns**: Light use of alliteration and assonance; rhyme is rare except in dialogue or playful moments.  
- **Rhythm Patterns**: Consistent narrative rhythm, with occasional “call and response” in dialogue.

**Narrative Voice**  
- **Perspective**: Usually third-person limited, often close to the child protagonist’s experience.  
- **Tone**: Warm, gently adventurous, and reassuring; sometimes quietly humorous, never sarcastic or cynical.  
- **Relationship to Reader**: Inclusive, with occasional direct address to draw the child in, but mostly observational.  
- **Emotional Range**: Builds from curiosity to wonder, with moments of mild tension always resolved in a comforting manner.

**Story Structure Preferences**  
- **Opening Style**: Often begins with ordinary settings that quickly introduce a sense of possibility or mystery.  
- **Problem Introduction**: Challenges are presented as natural extensions of the child’s world, often arising from curiosity or a small act of independence.  
- **Resolution Style**: Problems are resolved through the child’s agency, cleverness, or kindness, often with a touch of magic or the unexpected.  
- **Ending Patterns**: Satisfying closure, sometimes with a gentle moral or reflective note, but rarely heavy-handed.

**Character Voice Patterns**  
- **Dialogue Style**: Conversational and authentic; child characters speak in a natural, age-appropriate way.  
- **Internal Thoughts**: Frequently shown, especially to clarify the child’s motives or feelings.  
- **Character Interactions**: Collaborative and supportive, with conflicts arising from misunderstandings or external challenges, not meanness.  
- **Child Agency**: High—the child protagonist drives the story through curiosity, bravery, or empathy.

#### **Interactive Story Adaptations**

**Choice Point Integration**  
- **Choice Presentation Style**: Options are presented as natural extensions of the story, framed as questions or possibilities the child might consider.  
- **Decision Language**: “Would you like to...?” or “Do you think...?”—inviting participation without breaking narrative flow.  
- **Consequence Description**: Outcomes are described with clarity and empathy, showing both the immediate result and the emotional impact.  
- **Moral Integration**: Lessons are woven in gently, often through the natural consequences of the child’s choices, never preached.

**Personalization Elements**  
- **Name Integration**: {{childName}} appears as the protagonist, with the name used in narration and dialogue in a way that feels organic, not forced.  
- **Child Involvement**: Direct participation in problem-solving and discovery; the child is an active agent, not just an observer.  
- **Emotional Connection**: Bonds are formed through shared adventure and gentle humor; the child is valued and respected.  
- **Learning Integration**: Implicit, through exploration and discovery; explicit teaching is rare.
