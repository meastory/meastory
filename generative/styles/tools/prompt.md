# Author Style Guide Generation Prompt

## Task Overview
I need you to analyze the writing style of **[AUTHOR NAME]** and create a comprehensive style guide using the attached template. This guide will help us write interactive children's stories that capture the distinctive voice, rhythm, and storytelling approach of this author without copying any copyrighted content.

## Context & Purpose
We're creating interactive "choose your own adventure" style stories for a video call storytelling app, where family members (like grandparents) read personalized stories to children remotely. We want to adapt public domain stories using beloved authors' distinctive writing styles to create high-quality, engaging content.

The stories will:
- Feature the child as the protagonist using {{childName}} placeholder
- Include branching decision points appropriate for ages 3-8
- Be optimized for read-aloud delivery over video calls
- Maintain educational value while being entertaining

## Author to Analyze: [AUTHOR NAME]

## Your Assignment
Using the attached style guide template, please:

1. **Analyze the author's distinctive style elements** including:
   - Rhythm, meter, and flow patterns
   - Vocabulary choices and sentence structure
   - Repetitive elements (refrains, patterns, sounds)
   - Narrative voice and tone
   - Story structure preferences
   - Character development approaches

2. **Identify interactive story adaptations** including:
   - How this author would naturally present choices
   - Ways to integrate {{childName}} seamlessly
   - How their style translates to branching narratives
   - Educational integration methods

3. **Provide specific linguistic patterns** including:
   - Common sentence starters and structures
   - Transitional phrases

4. **Optimize for video call delivery** including:
   - Natural pause points for remote interaction
   - Emphasis patterns for read-aloud

5. **Include practical examples** showing:
   - Opening style with {{childName}} integration
   - How choice points would be presented
   - Resolution/ending style
   - Sample passages demonstrating the voice

## Key Requirements
- Focus on **style elements** (rhythm, voice, structure) rather than specific copyrighted content
- Ensure all recommendations work for **ages 3-8** with some age scalability
- Prioritize elements that enhance **video call storytelling**
- Consider how the style adapts to **interactive/choice-based narratives**

## Quality Standards
The final style guide should be detailed enough that a writer unfamiliar with this author could:
- Recognize the style when they see it
- Write new content that captures the essential voice and rhythm
- Adapt the style to interactive storytelling formats
- Maintain consistency across different story branches
- Create engaging read-aloud experiences for video calls

## Deliverable
Please fill out the complete style guide template, providing specific, actionable guidance for each section. Focus on concrete, observable patterns rather than general descriptions.
