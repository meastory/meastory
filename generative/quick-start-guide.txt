New Story Creation Setup:
Required Inputs:

Prompt 1A from story_generation_engine.md (with your placeholders filled in)
Framework Template (story_framework_template.md)
Author Style Guide (completed for your chosen author) from /styles
Original Source Story Text (the public domain story you're adapting) from /sources

Placeholder Updates Needed:

[STORY_TITLE] → actual story name (e.g., "Jack and the Beanstalk")
[AUTHOR_NAME] → target style (e.g., "Julia Donaldson")
[AGE_RANGE] → specific range (e.g., "3-6 years")

Process Flow:

Start fresh conversation
Paste customized Prompt 1A
Attach all three documents
Work through prompts 1A → 12A systematically
Each prompt builds on the previous outputs

Why This Approach Works:
Complete Information:
The framework template gives structure guidance, the style guide ensures authentic voice, and the source story provides narrative foundation.
Systematic Quality:
The 12-step process ensures nothing is missed and maintains consistency across different stories and authors.
Flexibility Within Structure:
You can adapt any public domain story in any author's style while maintaining your interactive format requirements.
One Small Refinement Suggestion:
Consider creating a quick reference checklist for yourself:
□ Framework template attached
□ Style guide for [AUTHOR] attached  
□ Source story text attached
□ Placeholders updated in Prompt 1A
□ Age range appropriate for story complexity
□ Ready to work through all 12 prompts systematically
This will help ensure you don't miss any pieces when starting new story conversations.
Your approach is solid and should produce consistently excellent interactive stories that work perfectly for video call storytelling while respecting copyright boundaries. You're all set to build an amazing library of content!
